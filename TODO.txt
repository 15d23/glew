Major:
 - add support for windows mini-client drivers
 - add support for initialization on first use
    - This is probably a simple change: just define that the programmer
      *has* to call either of glewGetExtension or glewInit as the first
      GLEW function he uses.  If it's glewExtension, then that function
      performs the initialization.
 - add windows installer (msi)
 - add ati/nvidia custom profile
 - separate build of static and shared object files (for mingw and
 cygwin)
 - make auto scripts work with text mode cygwin mounts
 - start designing GLEW 2.0

Minor:
 - add support for all SUN, MTX, and OML extensions
 - make auto/Makefile more robust against auto/core/*~ mistakes
 - web poll on separating glew, glxew and wglew
