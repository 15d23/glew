Major:
 - separate build of static and shared object files
 - add support for initialization on first use
    - This is probably a simple change: just define that the programmer
      *has* to call either of glewGetExtension or glewInit as the first
      GLEW function he uses.  If it's glewExtension, then that function
      performs the initialization.

Minor:
 - add support for all SUN, MTX, and OML extensions
 - fix SGI hyperpipe stuff
 - make auto/Makefile more robust against auto/core/*~ mistakes
 - web poll on separating glew, glxew and wglew
